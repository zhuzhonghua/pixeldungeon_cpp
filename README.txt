PixelDungeon 
A greate roguelike game
https://github.com/watabou/pixel-dungeon

I am rewritting the game with c++.
It's a learning and fun.

There is a file named lang.xml in the data directory.
It's the language file.

SDL+OpenGL are used and many other software code.

The gamescene is not well rewritten.

Maybe in the future, I will use lua to program those code.

Even use javascript to rewrite the entire game.

There is a vs project file.

It's easy to port to other platform(mac, linux, android, ios).

TODO:
1.rewrite left code(especially gamescene related code).
2.embed lua to this project to extend other features
3.port to other platform(mac, linux, android, ios)
